# About Me

I am a PhD student in the Computer Science Department, School of Computer Science, at Carnegie Mellon University with a research interest in database management systems (DBMSs), specifically "self-driving" systems. I am extremely fortunate to be advised by [Andy Pavlo](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/), and I am a member of the [Database Group (CMU-DB)](https://db.cs.cmu.edu/) and [Parallel Data Lab](https://www.pdl.cmu.edu/).

I previously completed a BS in Electrical and Computer Engineering in December 2020. Prior to graduate school, I worked at SingleStore (formerly MemSQL) for a year.
